						<aside class="notes">
							<p>A lot of knowledge seems to be shared through conversation, that's great but with staff constantly coming and going we might be missing some opportunities for collaboration</p>
							<p>Can we improve the ways we stay informed of:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Other community services</li>
								<li>Other courts at all levels</li>
								<li>Local and state government</li>

								oustide of staff meetings or centre wide emails.</p>
							<p>How do we refine what has been tried and worked, how do improve something that might not have worked?</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Sharing our successes</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
